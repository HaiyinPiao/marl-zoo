# marl-zoo
A multi-agent reinforcement learning sdk, inhereted and significant modified from https://github.com/Khrylx/PyTorch-RL  
  
Algorithms Supported:  
1)multi-agent ppo with one unified mlp p,v net and trained with one sum team reward.  
2)multi-agent ppo with one unified transformer-encoder p,v net and trained with separte isolate reward. 
3)multi-agent ppo with dec-mdp mlp p,v net and trained with one sum team reward.  
4)multi-agent ppo with dec-mdp transformer-encoder p,v net and trained with separte isolate reward.
